Every day we receive messages from users with comments and suggestions, which we treat very carefully.<span id="dotsOne">...</span> <span id="moreOne">
                  Our developers are working hard to improve the application. Already on iOS (v0.93.32) we have optimized the SFERA Feed code and the unread message counter functionality in ASAP, which allows you to quickly find bugs and make improvements to the App.Android (v0.0.94) rewritten the logic of the message time, which fixed bugs with the order of messages and repetition of dates between them. Bugs occurring during video or audio calls have been fixed, as well as the functionality for displaying links in the chat information has been added. Released the pagination of Chronicles in the Main Profile, which allows you to display content in the feed in chronological order.Our team thanks you for helping to make the SFERA App better! We kindly ask you to actively use the application and inform our team about the system’s shortcomings and suggestions for improvement.
